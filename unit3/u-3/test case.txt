### **Test Case: Detailed Explanation**

**Definition**: A **test case** is a set of conditions, inputs, and expected results that defines how a particular test will be executed to verify whether a system behaves as expected.

---

### **Components of a Test Case**

1. **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for the test case (e.g., TC_001).
2. **Test Case Name**: Descriptive title of what is being tested.
3. **Test Description**: A brief explanation of what the test aims to validate.
4. **Pre-conditions**: The state the system must be in before the test can begin (e.g., user must be logged in).
5. **Test Steps**: A sequence of actions to execute the test (e.g., open login page, enter credentials).
6. **Test Data**: Specific data used during the test (e.g., username: `testuser`, password: `Test@123`).
7. **Expected Result**: What should happen after executing the test steps (e.g., user is redirected to the dashboard).
8. **Actual Result**: The actual outcome after executing the test, compared with the expected result.
9. **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Defines the conditions under which the test passes or fails.
10. **Post-conditions**: Any conditions that should exist after the test (e.g., user remains logged in).
11. **Priority**: The importance level of the test case (e.g., high, medium, low).
12. **Comments**: Additional notes about the test (e.g., tested on Chrome version 92).

### **How a Successful Test Case Looks**

A successful test case should be:
1. **Clear**: Easy to understand and follow.
2. **Comprehensive**: Includes all necessary details like inputs, expected results, and pass/fail criteria.
3. **Reproducible**: Can be executed consistently with the same outcome.
4. **Measurable**: Defines measurable outcomes (e.g., if the user is logged in or redirected).

### **Example Test Case**

| **Test Case ID**    | TC_001                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Test Case Name**   | Login Test                          |
| **Test Description** | Verify successful login with valid credentials |
| **Pre-conditions**   | User must be registered.            |
| **Test Steps**       | 1. Open login page.<br>2. Enter username and password.<br>3. Click "Login". |
| **Test Data**        | Username: `testuser`, Password: `Test@123` |
| **Expected Result**  | User is redirected to the dashboard. |
| **Actual Result**    | User was redirected.                |
| **Pass/Fail Criteria** | Pass if redirected to dashboard.   |
| **Priority**         | High                                 |

### **Conclusion**

A test case is essential for verifying the software's functionality. It should be clear, repeatable, and provide measurable outcomes, ensuring the application behaves as expected under various conditions.
