25.1 REACTIVE Vs. PROACTIVE RISK STRATEGY 

25.2 S/W RISKS : two characteristics, 
Uncertainty : risk may or may not happen, no 100% probability 
Loss : if risk becomes real, unwanted consequences / losses 
Necessary to quantify uncertainty & degree of losses, categories are : 

1.Project risk : threatens project plan, project schedule to slip, cost 
increase, risks are - potential budgetary, schedule, personnel, resources & 
requirement problems & their impact 
2.Technical risks : threatens quality & timeliness, implementation 
difficult, risks are - potential design, implementation, interfacing & 
maintenance problem, specification ambiguity, technical uncertainty & 
obsolescence, cause is underestimation 
3.Business risks : viability of s/w, (1) market risk (2) strategic risks (3) 
sales risk (4) management risk (5) budget risk 
Other categorization is : 
1. Known risks : uncovered by careful evaluation of project plan, business 
& technical env, other info - unrealistic delivery data, poor development 
env 
2. Predictable risks : from past project experience, poor communication, 
dilution of staff  effort, staff turnover etc 
3. Unpredictable risks : do occur, difficult to identify in advance



25.3 RISK IDENTIFICATION

To identify risks, risks item checklist, focus on known & predictable risks, 
subcategories are : 
1. Product size : overall size of s/w 
2. Business impact – constraints by mgmt & market 
3. Customer characteristics : customer sophistication & communication 
4. Process definition – degree of s/w process defined & followed 
5. Development env : availability & quality of tools 
6. Technology to be built – complexity & new tech 
7. Staff size & experience – technical & project experience



25.3.2 RISK COMPONENTS & DRIVERS : 
Project manager must identify risk drivers that affect risk components – 
performance, cost, support & schedule, defined as : 
1. Performance risk : degree of uncertainty that product will meet its 
requirements & fit for its intended use 
2. Cost risks : project budget be maintained 
3. Support risks : s/w easy to correct, adapt & enhance 
4. Schedule risks : project schedule be maintained & on time delivery 
 
Impact of risk drivers on risk components in 4 categories – negligible, 
marginal, critical & catastrophic, figure indicates potential consequences of 
errors & failure to achieve desired result




25.4 RISK PROJECTION : 
 
Risk projection/ estimation, rate each risk for its probability/likelihood that 
risk on (1) risk is real & (2) consequences of problems if risks occur, risk 
projection activities are : (1) establish a scale that indicate probability of risk 
(2) delineate consequences of risk (3) impact of risk on project & product (4) 
analyze risk projection

25.4.1 Developing a Risk Table : Risk table a technique for risk projection,
1.. catastrophic 
2. critical 
3. marginal 
4. negligible 



25.4.2 ASSESSING RISK IMPACT : determined by three factors – nature, 
scope & timing, nature indicates problem ex poorly defined i/f to h/w lead 
integration problem, scope refers severity & distribution, timing refers when 
& how long, consequences of risk can be determined : 
1. Determine avg prob of occurrence for each risk component 
2. Using table, determine impact for each compo 
3. Complete the risk table & analyze results
