### **Sequence Diagram**

A **Sequence Diagram** is a type of interaction diagram in UML that illustrates how objects interact with each other in a particular sequence of time. It is also known as an **event diagram** and is primarily used to model the **dynamic behavior** of a system.

It represents the **flow of messages** between different system components and shows how these components (called lifelines) collaborate during execution. Each lifeline is depicted as a vertical bar, and the **messages exchanged** between them are shown as horizontal arrows in a **time-ordered** manner from top to bottom.

It supports **iterations** and **branching** conditions to represent various control flow constructs within a system.

### **Purpose of a Sequence Diagram**

1. **Model high-level interactions** among active objects in a system.
2. **Illustrate interactions** between objects within a collaboration to realize a use case.
3. **Capture both generic and specific scenarios** of interactions in the system.

### **Notations of a Sequence Diagram**
(*Slide No: 53*)
- **Lifeline**: Vertical bar representing an object or participant.
- **Message**: Horizontal arrows showing communication between lifelines.
- **Activation bar**: Thin vertical rectangle showing the time an object is active.
- **Return message**: Dashed arrow showing the return of control.
- **Loops/Conditions**: Boxes or frames to represent loops, conditions, or alternatives.
- **Destruction**: An 'X' at the end of a lifeline indicating object destruction.

### **Benefits of a Sequence Diagram**

- Provides a clear visualization of **real-time application behavior**.
- Effectively **illustrates message flow** between system objects.
- Ensures **easy maintenance** and system updates.
- Can be **easily generated** with modern UML tools.
- Supports both **forward and reverse engineering**.
- Easily **adaptable to changes** in system requirements.

### **Drawbacks of a Sequence Diagram**

- Becomes **complex with too many lifelines**, reducing readability.
- Incorrect **message order** may lead to inaccurate system representation.
- Requires **distinct notations** for each interaction type, which can be overwhelming.
- The **type of sequence** and diagram depends on the **type of message**, adding complexity.
