### **UML Activity Diagram**

A **UML Activity Diagram** is a behavioral diagram that represents the flow of control or data within a system. It primarily focuses on the *dynamic aspects* of the system and helps visualize the sequence of activities and decisions involved in a process. Unlike implementation diagrams, activity diagrams emphasize how the system behaves rather than how it is built.

### **Purpose of Activity Diagrams**

- To **demonstrate the flow of control** in a system, especially useful during analysis and design phases.
- To **model sequential, branched, or concurrent flows** using constructs like **fork**, **join**, and **decision nodes**.
- To **visualize workflows** from one activity to another and understand how the system transitions between states.
- To **highlight conditions** affecting flow and **capture decision logic**.
- Often referred to as **object-oriented flowcharts**, they help in illustrating real-world workflows.

### **Why Use Activity Diagrams?**

- To **model the behavior of activities** within use cases, classes, interfaces, components, and collaborations.
- To **represent processes and workflows** visually in a simple, understandable manner.
- To **envision dynamic behavior** of systems during runtime.
- To **construct runnable systems** via forward or reverse engineering.
- To **generate top-level flowcharts** for high-level system design.
- Ideal for **business process modeling** and **functional flow analysis**.

> **Note**: Activity diagrams do *not* include message flows; those are captured in sequence diagrams.

### **Key Components of an Activity Diagram**

1. **Activity Partitions (Swimlanes):**  
   Used to organize activities based on responsibilities (e.g., different departments or systems).

2. **Forks and Joins:**  
   - **Forks** split a flow into multiple concurrent paths.  
   - **Joins** combine concurrent paths back into a single flow.

3. **Pins:**  
   Represent inputs and outputs of actions, especially when using object flow.

4. **Decision Nodes and Merge Nodes:**  
   Represent branching and merging in control flows.

### **How to Draw an Activity Diagram**

1. **Gather Requirements:**  
   Understand the use case or process you are modeling.

2. **Prototype or Abstract Model:**  
   Sketch a rough flow before finalizing the diagram.

3. **Follow Key Rules:**
   - Assign **meaningful names** to activities.
   - Identify **constraints and conditions**.
   - Define **associations between activities** clearly.

4. **Use Standard Notations:**  
   - **Ovals** or **rounded rectangles** for activities.  
   - **Diamonds** for decisions.  
   - **Bars** for fork/join.  
   - **Arrows** for control flow.  
   *(As per standard UML notation, e.g., Slide No. 109)*

### **When to Use Activity Diagrams**

- To **graphically model workflows** or processes.
- To **represent execution flow** across multiple activities or operations.
- To **model algorithms** or functions in detail.
- For **business process modeling** and performance analysis.
- To **visualize system behavior dynamically** in object-oriented or distributed systems.
