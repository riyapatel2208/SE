Sequence Diagram
 • Represents the flow of messages in the system and is also termed as an event diagram
 • It helps in envisioning several dynamic scenarios
 • It portrays the communication between any two lifelines as a timeordered sequence of events, such that these lifelines took part at the run time
 • In UML, the lifeline is represented by a vertical bar, whereas the message flow is represented by a vertical dotted line that extends across the bottom of the page
 • It incorporates the iterations as well as branching



Purpose of a Sequence Diagram
 1. To model high-level interaction among active objects within a system
 2. To model interaction among objects inside a collaboration realizing a use case
 3. It either models generic interactions or some certain instances of interaction

Benefits of a Sequence Diagram
 • It explores the real-time application
 • It depicts the message flow between the different objects
 • It has easy maintenance
 • It is easy to generate
 • Implement both forward and reverse engineering
 • It can easily update as per the new change in the system


Drawbacks of a Sequence Diagram
 • In the case of too many lifelines, the sequence diagram can get more complex
 • The incorrect result may be produced, if the order of the flow of messages changes
 • Since each sequence needs distinct notations for its representation, it may make the diagram more complex
 • The type of sequence is decided by the type of message
