UML Activity Diagram
 • Is used to demonstrate the flow of control within the system rather than the implementation
 • It models the concurrent and sequential activities
 • The activity diagram helps in envisioning the workflow from one activity to another
 • It put emphasis on the condition of flow and the order in which it occurs
 • The flow can be sequential, branched, or concurrent, and to deal with such kinds of flows, the activity diagram has come up with a fork, join, etc
 • It is also termed as an object-oriented flowchart
 • It encompasses activities composed of a set of actions or operations that are applied to model the behavioral diagram



Components of an Activity Diagram
(1) Activity partition /swimlane
(2) Forks
(3) Join Nodes
(4) Pins

Why use Activity Diagram?
 • An event is created as an activity diagram encompassing a group of nodes associated with edges
 • To model the behavior of activities, they can be attached to any modeling element
 • It can model use cases, classes, interfaces, components, and collaborations
 • It mainly models processes and workflows
 • It envisions the dynamic behavior of the system as well as constructs a runnable system that incorporates forward and reverse engineering
 • It does not include the message part, which means message flow is not represented in an activity diagram
 • It is the same as that of a flowchart but not exactly a flowchart itself
 • It is used to depict the flow between several activities


How to draw an Activity Diagram?
 • After gathering all the essential information, an abstract or a prototype is built, which is then transformed into the actual diagram
 • Following are the rules that are to be followed for drawing an activity diagram:
 1. A meaningful name should be given to each and every activity
 2. Identify all of the constraints
 3. Acknowledge the activity associations



When to use an Activity Diagram?
 • To graphically model the workflow in an easier and understandable way
 • To model the execution flow among several activities
 • To model comprehensive information of a function or an algorithm employed within the system
 • To model the business process and its workflow
 • To envision the dynamic aspect of a system
 • To generate the top-level flowcharts for representing the workflow of an application
 • To represent a high-level view of a distributed or an object-oriented system
