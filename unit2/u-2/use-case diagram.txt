UML Use Case Diagram
 • To represent the dynamic behavior of a system
 • It encapsulates the system's functionality by incorporating use cases, actors, and their relationships
 • It models the tasks, services, and functions required by a system/subsystem of an application
 • It depicts the high-level functionality of a system and also tells how the user handles a system


Purpose of Use Case Diagrams
 • Main purpose is to portray the dynamic aspect of a system
 • It accumulates the system's requirement, which includes both internal as well as external influences
 • It invokes persons, use cases, and several things that invoke the actors and elements accountable for the implementation of use case diagrams
 • It represents how an entity from the external environment can interact with a part of the system
	1. It gathers the system's needs
 	2. It depicts the external view of the system
 	3. It recognizes the internal as well as external factors that influence the system
 	4. It represents the interaction between the actors



How to draw a Use Case diagram?
 • Analyze the whole system before starting with drawing a use case diagram, and then the system's functionalities are found
 • Once every single functionality is identified, they are then transformed into the use cases to be used in the use case diagram
 • After that, enlist the actors that will interact with the system
 • The actors are the person or a thing that invokes the functionality of a system
 • It may be a system or a private entity, such that it requires an entity to be pertinent to the functionalities of the system to which it is going to interact
 • Once both the actors and use cases are enlisted, the relation between the actor and use case/ system is inspected
 • It identifies the no of times an actor communicates with the system
 • Basically, an actor can interact multiple times with a use case or system at a particular instance of time
	1. A pertinent and meaningful name should be assigned to the actor or a use case of a system
 	2. The communication of an actor with a use case must be defined in an understandable way
 	3. Specified notations to be used as and when required
 	4. The most significant interactions should be represented among the multiple no of interactions between the use case and actors



Important tips for drawing a Use Case diagram
 • A simple and complete use case diagram should be articulated
 • A use case diagram should represent the most significant interaction among the multiple interactions
 • At least one module of a system should be represented by the use case diagram
 • If the use case diagram is large and more complex, then it should be drawn more generalized
