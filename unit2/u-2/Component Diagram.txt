UML Component Diagram
 • It is used to break down a large object-oriented system into the smaller components, so as to make them more manageable
 • It models the physical view of a system such as executables, files, libraries, etc. that resides within the node
 • It visualizes the relationships as well as the organization between the components present in the system
 • It helps in forming an executable system
 • A component is a single unit of the system, which is replaceable and executable
 • The implementation details of a component are hidden, and it necessitates an interface to execute a function
 • It is like a black box whose behavior is explained by the provided and required interfaces

Purpose of a Component Diagram
 • It describes all the individual components that are used to make the functionalities, but not the functionalities of the system
 • It visualizes the physical components inside the system
 • The components can be a library, packages, files, etc.
 • The component diagram also describes the static view of a system, which includes the organization of components at a particular instant
 • The collection of component diagrams represents a whole system
 1. It envisions each component of a system
 2. It constructs the executable by incorporating forward and reverse engineering
 3. It depicts the relationships and organization of components



Why use Component Diagram?
 • It is used to depict the functionality and behavior of all the components present in the system, unlike other diagrams that are used to represent the architecture of the system, working of a system, or simply the system itself
 • In UML, the component diagram portrays the behavior and organization of components at any instant of time
 • The system cannot be visualized by any individual component, but it can be by the collection of components
 1. It portrays the components of a system at the runtime
 2. It is helpful in testing a system
 3. It envisions the links between several connections




When to use a Component Diagram?
 • To divide a single system into multiple components according to the functionality
 • To represent the component organization of the system



How to Draw a Component Diagram?
 • Once the system is designed employing different UML diagrams, and the artifacts are prepared, the component diagram is used to get an idea of implementation
 • It plays an essential role in implementing applications efficiently.
 • Following are some artifacts that are needed to be identified before drawing a component diagram:
 1. What files are used inside the system?
 2. What is the application of relevant libraries and artifacts?
 3. What is the relationship between the artifacts?
 • Some points that are needed to be kept in mind after the artifacts are identified:
 1. Using a meaningful name to ascertain the component for which the diagram is about to be drawn
 2. Before producing the required tools, a mental layout is to be made
 3. To clarify the important points, notes can be incorporated




Where to use Component Diagrams?
 • To model the components of the system
 • To model the schemas of a database
 • To model the applications of an application
 • To model the system's source code
