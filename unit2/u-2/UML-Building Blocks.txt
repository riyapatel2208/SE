*********************UML-Building Blocks************************
 • UML is composed of three main building blocks
 	 • Things
	 • Relationships
	 • Diagrams
 • Building blocks generate one complete UML model diagram by rotating around several different blocks
 • It plays an essential role in developing UML diagrams

---->(1) Things
 • Anything that is a real world entity or object is termed as things. It can be divided into several different categories:
 • Structural things
	- Nouns that depicts the static behavior of a model is termed as structural things
 	- They display the physical and conceptual components
 	- They include class, object, interface, node, collaboration, component, and a use case

 • Behavioral things
 	- They are the verbs that encompass the dynamic parts of a model
	- It depicts the behavior of a system
 	- They involve state machine, activity diagram, interaction diagram, grouping things, annotation things

 • Grouping things
	- It is a method that together binds the elements of the UML model
	- In UML, the package is the only thingwhich is used for grouping of behavioral and structural things

 • Annotational things
	- It is a mechanism that captures the remarks, descriptions, and comments of UML model elements
	- In UML, a note is the only Annotational thing
	- It is used to attach the constraints, comments, and rules to the elements of the model
	- It is a kind of yellow sticky note.

---->(2) relationship
• It illustrates the meaningful connections between things
• It shows the association between the entities and defines the functionality of an application
• There are four types of relationships
 • Dependency
	- A kind of relationship in which a change in target element affects the source element, or simply we can say the source element is dependent on the target element
	- It is one of the most important notations in UML
	- It is used in class diagrams, component diagrams, deployment diagrams, and use-case diagrams, which indicates that a change to the supplier necessitates a change to the client
	- It depicts the dependency from one entity to another.
	- It is denoted by a dotted line followed by an arrow at one side as shown below
	----Dependency---->

 • Association 
	- A set of links that associates the entities to the UML model
	- It tells how many elements are actually taking part in forming that relationship
	- It is denoted by a dotted line with arrowheads on both sides to describe the relationship with the element on both sides
	<----Association ---->
	- types are(Aggregation, Composition)

 • Generalization
	- It portrays the relationship between a general thing (a parent class or superclass) and a specific kind of that thing (a child class or subclass)
	- It is used to describe the concept of inheritance
	- It is denoted by a straight line followed by an empty arrowhead at one side
	-Generalization->

 • Realization
	It is a semantic kind of relationship between two things, where one defines the behavior to be carried out, and the other one implements the mentioned behavior
	It exists in interfaces
	It is denoted by a dotted line with an empty arrowhead at one side
	----Realization--->


---->(3) Diagram

 • Graphical implementation of the models that incorporate symbols and text
 • Each symbol has a different meaning in the context of the UML diagram
 • There are thirteen different types of UML diagrams that are available in UML 2.0
 • Each diagram has its own set of a symbol
 • And each diagram manifests a different dimension, perspective, and view of the system
 • UML diagrams are classified into three categories 
	• Structural Diagram
		• Represents the static view of a system by portraying the structure of a system
 		• It shows several objects residing in the system
 		• Structural diagrams are:
 			• Class diagram
 			• Object diagram
 			• Package diagram
 			• Component diagram
 			• Deployment diagram

 	• Behavioral Diagram
		• Depicts the behavioral features of a system
 		• Deals with dynamic parts of the system
 		• They are:
 			• Activity diagram
 			• State machine diagram
 			• Use case diagram

 	• Interaction Diagram
		• A subset of behavioral diagrams
 		• Depicts the interaction between two objects and the data flow between them
 		• They are :
			• Timing diagram
 			• Sequence diagram
			• Collaboration diagram




-------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are definitions or key points for each UML diagram under the three categories:

---

### **1. Structural Diagrams**  
(Show static structure of the system)

- **Class Diagram**  
  Represents the classes in a system, along with their attributes, methods, and relationships.

- **Object Diagram**  
  Shows instances (objects) of classes and their relationships at a specific moment in time.

- **Package Diagram**  
  Organizes elements into packages to show dependencies and organization of model elements.

- **Component Diagram**  
  Displays components (modular parts) of a system and their interrelationships, often used in system implementation.

- **Deployment Diagram**  
  Represents the physical deployment of artifacts (software) on hardware nodes.

---

### **2. Behavioral Diagrams**  
(Focus on what the system does)

- **Activity Diagram**  
  Represents workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for conditions and parallelism.

- **State Machine Diagram**  
  Describes the states an object goes through in response to events and the transitions between states.

- **Use Case Diagram**  
  Shows interactions between actors (users or other systems) and the system to capture system functionality.

---

### **3. Interaction Diagrams**  
(Subset of behavioral diagrams showing interactions)

- **Timing Diagram**  
  Shows object states over time and is used to model timing constraints.

- **Sequence Diagram**  
  Illustrates the sequence of messages exchanged between objects to carry out a function or process.

- **Collaboration Diagram** (also called Communication Diagram)  
  Emphasizes the structural organization of the objects that send and receive messages.
